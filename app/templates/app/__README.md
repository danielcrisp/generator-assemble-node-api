# App Source Directory

Welcome to your new project.

## Directories

The `app` directory contains all of the source code for your project - you should only need to edit files in this directory.

Contained within this directory you will find two main directories:

 - `www` - this contains all your HTML, CSS, JS etc for the front end of the project
 - `api` - this contains the mock RESTFUL JSON API for your scripts to request fake data from

## API documentation

In addition you may also find the following directory:

**DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES**

 - `_apidocs` - This directory contains the automatically generated documentation for your API

The API docs are generated by grunt:

 - when the dev server is started (`$ grunt serve`)
 - when the project is compiled (`$ grunt build`)
 - when the apidocs grunt task is run (`$ grunt apidocs`)

## Server files

There are also a number of files required for the deployed version of the app.
When the project is compiled these files are renamed without the preceeding underscores.

Currently there are four files:

- `_deploy.js` - Node.js script to start the API, serve the `www` directory and password protect the site (if required, see below)
- `_iisnode.yml` - IIS config
- `_package.json` - NPM package, defines required node modules (keep this updated if you add any modules for your API)
- `_web.config` - IIS config

## Password protection

Password protection for the compiled project is enabled by default. The login details are:

**Username:** username
**Password:** password

The login details can be changed in `_deploy.js` by editing the following line:

    app.use(basicAuth('username', 'password'));

If you wish to disable password protection simply comment-out or remove the line.
